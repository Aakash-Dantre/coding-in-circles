## Changes Made
Initial ER Diagram:

![](ER_initial.png)

- "User" shouldn't have a "Standard User" as a subclass
- "Tags" is a multivalued attribute
- "Languages" in the relation "Question" is a multivalued attribute
- "Results In" is an identifying relationship
- "Solves" is an identifying relationship
- "Has" is an identifying relationship

Modified ER Diagram:
